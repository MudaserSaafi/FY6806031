  There is so much that goes into the development of automobiles, and the Bugatti Chiron is no exception. Founder Ettore Bugatti’s main goal was to put his automobiles on the map, to express his automobiles engineering magnificence to the entire world. Bugatti being founded in the French City of Molsheim, Alsace in 1909 and winning its first Le Mans 24 hour race in just 28 years and remaining the reigning champion for the next 10 years boasted Bugatti’s mechanical and engineering excellence to the world. However, after the death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 and his son Jean Bugatti who died testing a Bugatti Type 57 race car 6 years prior, there would be no true successor. The once renown automotive marvel would spiral uncontrollably through more series of unfortunate events, until Bugatti was bought by the Volkswagen Group in 1998 leading to a revival of a legacy. The VW group’s main goal was to revive the legacy of Bugatti. They planned to supply an unprecedented amount of power to their first automobile in the Bugatti-VW era, the Bugatti Veyron, an amount of power that was thought be impossible in a production car, 1001 metric horsepower with the birth of a quad turbocharged W-16 engine. Having obliterated the previous speed record 241 mph by over 25 mph, having written their name in the history books forever, they were not finished just yet. Coming out with this statement “The challenge to break the 300mph barrier has long been an ambition of the automotive world. A speed few can comprehend…” Bugatti (2019) Bugatti Chiron breaks through magic 300mph barrier. Available at: https://youtu.be/FuS_bXJNync?si=u6TjlGDv_YwcpxCX  (Accessed: 28th of October 2023). Bugatti was heading towards uncharted territory.

  “Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
  intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
  learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
  candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
  to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
  Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
  sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
  2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
  presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
  labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
  subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
  learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
  reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
  classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”
